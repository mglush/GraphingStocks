# Graphing Stocks

Graphing stock market tickers and the statistical analysis indicators that come with them. Implementing a multitude of trading strategies based on these indicators. Backtesting the trading strategies, seeing which indicator sets work best.

## The Work So Far:

First stock worked on: '$WKHS'
* Charted the ![closing price](/Chart.jpg) of the ticker
* Able to look at the Candlestick chart
* Use of Moving Averages and Bollinger Bands
* Buy/Sell Strategy 1: MA crossover


## Next Steps:
Implement the running of multiple simulations competing against each other on the stock market, with each simulation employing a different trading strategy
